# ARM Cortex-M4 Multimedia System

## Description
This project is developed for the IMT School/WazeefaTech Program and involves an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller (STM32F401RCTB) controlling a multimedia system. The system integrates a TFT display, an IR sensor, and an R2R DAC to display images, play audio, and respond to user input from a remote controller.

## Components
- ARM Cortex-M4 Microcontroller (STM32F401RCTB)
- TFT Display
- IR Sensor
- R2R DAC

## Features
- Displays images on the TFT display.
- Plays audio through the R2R DAC.
- Responds to user input from a remote controller via the IR sensor.
- Basic operating system for task management and scheduling.
